# Trello Clone App

This web app was originally developed by [Filip Hric](https://github.com/filiphric).
He gave me permission to use it for this Playwright tutorial.
I have copied its source code from https://github.com/filiphric/trelloapp-vue-vite-ts
into this repository to make the tutorial more convenient.

To run this app:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
